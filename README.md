dodecastep
==========

A library for Arduino to use three SparkFun Quadstepper Motor boards in parallel.

I needed to drive 10 stepper motors, so I took SparkFuns quadstep library and expanded it. It seems to work so far.
The code is commented, so it should be clear what to connect where. 

Sorry, this is my first github upload, I didn't get it how to create folders like for the example sketch and all. Next time, maybe.

Cheers
